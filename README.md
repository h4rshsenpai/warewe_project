### warewe_project
Personal project in django with an application for an e-commerce platform. This is to assess my skills in Python, particularly in using Django for web development, Cython for performance optimization, and AI for enhancing user experiences.


# Tasks:

Django Application Setup:
Create a Django project with an application for an e-commerce platform.
The application should include basic e-commerce features: product display, user cart, and checkout process.

Product Recommendation AI Model:
Implement a machine learning model for product recommendations. This could be based on user behavior, product attributes, or other criteria I deem appropriate.
I can use dummy data for training the model, or if available, a simple pre-trained recommendation system model.

Cython Optimization:
Identify a part of the application that is computation-heavy. This could be a section of the recommendation algorithm, data processing, or another suitable aspect. Implement this part in Cython, and integrate it with the Django application.

User Interaction:
It should with the recommendation system through the UI. For instance, viewing recommended products, providing feedback (likes, dislikes), and seeing updated recommendations based on their actions.
